Margin financing plays a role in amplifying trading leverage. For example, your principal is 1 million US dollars, and borrows 1 million US dollars from the broker, for a total of 2 million US dollars to buy stocks, this is a 2x leveraged financing. If the stock price rises 25%, your return on investment will be 50%. If the stock price falls by 25%, your return on investment will be -50%. It is recommended that customers utilising margin financing fully understands the risk of the service."},{"question":"How to enter margin financing transactions?","answer":"If you want to make margin financing transactions, you need to open a margin account.

For example, the investor has 10,000 USD initial margin in the account, and he is able to finance 30,000 USD in maximum and that makes up to 40,000 USD in total to be trading from. At the end of trading time of the day, the margin funding will be recalled, and the investor needs to make sure the leverage is repaid down to the overnight limit by then. For overnight funding, the most leverage ratio is 2x for US stocks. Therefore, the investor must sell some stocks before 3:50pm US ET and repay the margin funding down to 10,000 USD.\n\nAccounts with more than USD110,000 could be upgraded to Portfolio Margin Account, and be offered with more margin funding.

"},{"question":"How is the stock price that causes deficient margin calculated?","answer":"It is demonstrated in the following.\n\nFor example, the in-day maintenance margin rate is 25%, and the investor deposits 1m USD and borrows 500,000 USD to buy stock A total valued 1.5m USD. The margin is deficient where the stock price falls by x(%), makes net equity value equals required margin, where,\n\nNet equity value= 1500000*(1-x)-500000\nRequired margin=1500000*(1-x) *25%\n\nBy solving the equation, x is 55.56%, which means, liquidation is triggered when the stock prices fall by 55.56%."},{"question":"Is the position going to be partly liquidated when the margin goes into deficient?","answer":"In the case of a margin violation, the account in deficit is immediately subject to liquidation.  Automated liquidations are accomplished with market orders, and any/all positions in the account can be liquidated.   There are cases where, due to specific market conditions, a deficit is better addressed via a manual liquidation."},{"question":"What is securities financing or short selling?","answer":"It is the sale of a security that is not owned by the seller or that the seller has borrowed from broker.
